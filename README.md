## Calories Prediction Project with LightGBM
### Competition Overview
This project is part of the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series, aiming to predict calories burned during workouts using biometric and activity data.

Goal: Predict calorie expenditure based on features like age, height, weight, heart rate, and body temperature.

Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

Submission: CSV file with columns id and Calories.

Project Summary
Model: LightGBM regressor

Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding for sex, derived features like BMI and High_Body_Temp

Training: Early stopping to avoid overfitting

Evaluation: RMSLE metric

This project demonstrates effective feature engineering and model tuning to accurately predict calorie burn.
